## Usage

### Admin Panel

4. Control spacing and ordering
5. Publish/unpublish entries

### Frontend Display

You can display the before/after slider in your Blade views using Livewire:

For all portfolio types

```php
@livewire('sabhero-portfolio::before-after-slider')
```
Or

```bladehtml
<livewire:sabhero-portfolio::before-after-slider />
```

For specific portfolio types

```php
@livewire('sabhero-portfolio::before-after-slider', ['type' => 'commercial'])
```

Or

```bladehtml
<livewire:sabhero-portfolio::before-after-slider type="commercial" />
```

### Custom Portfolio Types

You can define custom portfolio types in the configuration file. Each type requires:
- A unique key (used in the database)
- A label (displayed in the UI, stored in lowercase)
- A color (used in the Filament admin panel)

### Custom Media Storage

By default, the package uses the disk configured in your Spatie Media Library config. You can override this in the package config

```php
// config/sabhero-portfolio.php
    'media' => [
        'disk' => 'public',
    ],
```
